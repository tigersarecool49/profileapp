In June 2005, the restaurant's owner Graphite Capital sold the majority stake of 77.5% to Lion Capital LLP for £103 million. In April 2011, the chain was sold to Duke Street Capital, for an estimated sum of £215 million.The word wagamama (わがまま) is Japanese for "self-indulgent", "self-centred", "disobedient", or "wilful" and is most often translated by the brand as "naughty child". Wagamama brands itself as following the process of kaizen.

The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $956 million).
